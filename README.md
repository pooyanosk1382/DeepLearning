# DeepLearning
This repository contains codes and summary of each lesson of the Deep Learning course.


# Artificial Neural Network
In this section we classify by neural network.

### Libraries:
__tensorflow__ is the best library for deep learning.

### Functions:
__keras.models.Sequential__ is used to make the **Neural Network**.

__keras.layers.Dense__ is used to add layer to **Neural Network**.

__compile__ is used to configure the model for training.


# Convolutional Neural Network

### Libraries:
__keras__ is used to preprocess pictures.

### Functions:
__ImageDataGenerator__ is used to bring all the pictures of training and test set to same scale.

__tf.keras.layers.Conv2D__ is used for step convolution.

__tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D__ is used for step pooling.

__tf.keras.layers.Flatten__ is used for step flattening.
